## Toolbox for identification of nonlinear state-space grey-box models

This toolbox supports multiple formulations of the optimization problem for parameter estimation: single shooting (SS), multiple shooting (MS), partially constrained multiple shooting (PCMS), and minimizing the N-step ahead prediction error starting from measured/inferred states (PEM):

## Quick start 

The basic steps of identification using this toolbox:

1. Design, build an perform experiment for system identification. Measure plant input and output. 
2. Define the grey-box model of your system in CasADi, as a continuous or discrete time nonlinear state-space model.
3. Use `nlgreyfast` to estimate the model parameters.

First, install the dependencies:
- MATLAB (tested with R2019b on Ubuntu),
- CasADi (tested with version 3.5.5), available [here](https://web.casadi.org/get/).
- Optional: MathWorks System Identification Toolbox (if not available, you can still use the `nlidcomb` interface).
- Optional: MATLAB Coder

Second, go through the script `nlgreyfast_emps_example.m` step by step.  
For an example of the `nlidcomb` interface, see: `nlidcomb_msd_example`.
