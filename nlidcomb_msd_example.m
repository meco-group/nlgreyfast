%% Identify a mass-spring-damper
% In this example, we will simulate the output of a mass-spring-damper system with known parameters (m, b and k),
% and will use different formulations of the optimal control problem (single shooting, multiple shooting, hybrid) 
% to identify those parameters, fitting its output to the previously simulated data.
% Variable name postfixes _v and _h correspond to vertical and horizontal vectors, 
% _V corresponds to a "tall" matrix (the data records are in rows), _H corresponds to a "long" matrix (the data records are in columns).

%% Settings
N = 10000;  % Number of samples that we will generate in simulation
fs = 1000; % Sampling frequency [Hz]
% To make the RK4 integration accurate, we will take intermediate steps in between the samples while calculating 
% the output of the system for a given input:
N_steps_per_sample = 10; 
% These are the known parameters [m;b;k] of the mass-spring-damper:
param_truth_v = [0.1;0.2;1];
% The solver will start from this guess of the parameters:
param_guess_v = [0.08;0.08;0.5];
% We can rescale the parameters to the same range (if needed) so that the solver will not fail due to numerical 
% problems. By default we apply no scaling: [1;1;1]
scale_v = [1;1;1];

%% Modeling
% At this point we will input the ODE for the mass-spring-damper:

% States:
y  = casadi.MX.sym('y'); 
dy = casadi.MX.sym('dy');
states_v = [y;dy];

% Inputs to the system:
u  = casadi.MX.sym('u'); %u is the input
controls_v = u;

% The parameters to estimate:
m = casadi.MX.sym('m');
b = casadi.MX.sym('b');
k = casadi.MX.sym('k');
params_v = [m;b;k];

% The ODEs are the following: 
% \dot y = dy
% \dot dy = (-k*dy-b*y+u)/m
% The functions in this toolbox expect the ODE to be specified as a CasADi function that returns the right hand side
% of the ODE, depending on the `states`, `controls` as the inputs, and `params` as the parameters to estimate.
rhs = [dy; (-k*dy-b*y+u)/m];
ode = casadi.Function('ode',{states_v,controls_v,params_v},{rhs}); % Form an ODE function

%% Simulate the system
% In this step we simulate the mass-spring-damper, given a random signal as input/excitation:
u_data_v = 0.1*rand(N,1); 
% ...starting from the following states:
x0_v = [0;0];
% Now we formulate a CasADi function that can perform the simulation (knowing the ones above):
[plant_next,all_samples] = nlsim(ode, fs, N-1, N_steps_per_sample); 
% Actually compute the simulation for x0 and u_data, for the known real parameters:
X_measured_H = full([x0_v all_samples(x0_v.', u_data_v(1:end-1).', repmat(param_truth_v,1,N-1))]); 
% Only some of the states will be measured / included in the output, their indexes are listed in the following array:
y_states_v = [1];
y_data_v = X_measured_H(y_states_v,:).'; %now actually select those states

% We may add some noise to this simulated output if we uncomment the line below. When noise is absent, the fit will be perfect.
%y_data_v = y_data_v + 0.001 * randn(size(y_data_v))

%% Single shooting / multiple shooting / hybrid shooting
% N_group_size = N; corresponds to single shooting formulation
% N_group_size = 1; corresponds to multiple shooting formulation
% N_group_size = 4; and any other integer value between 1 and N correspond to the hybrid shooting / partially 
%   constrained multiple shooting formulation
N_group_size = 4;

                        % However, CasADi will not be able to do thread-based parallelisation of multiple shooting.

% ## Notes on 'guess_mechatronic'
% In the MS and hybrid method, we have to give an initial guess on how the states evolve with time (the solver will later refine it). 
%     In a mechatronic system, where the ODE is like
%         \dot q = dq
%         \dot dq = something
%     if we measure all the q (as in the case of MSD), we can just use finite differences as a guess.
%     This specific case is denoted with 'guess_mechatronic'.
%     There are also other possibilities to pass as this parameter, e.g. you can provide a matrix with the values for the guesses,
%     or provide 'guess_exact' for a system which is like \dot dq = something.
